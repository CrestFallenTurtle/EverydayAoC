## Syntax and program layout

### Variable Declaration
Within each program there is a dedicated section where the programmer can declare all variables that will be utilized
during the programs execution and lifetime. This area begins with a `WAKE UP` followed by a simple variable declaration as can be seen in multiple languages.

#### Example
```
WAKE UP
 A = 10
 B = 20
 C = 30

...
```
The declaration area will continue until the function declaration area is declared.

No function calls are allowed to take place within this section, and are reserved to the function declaration and the main declaration.

### Function Declaration

### Main loop Declaration

### Exiting loop Declaration

### Program Layout

### Example program
```
WAKE UP
 A = 10
 B = 20

```
